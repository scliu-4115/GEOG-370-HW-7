<h1>Homework 7 </h1>

<h2>Map</h2>
<h3>The map shown below illustrates the number of low birthweights per 100 births in each county of Arizona in 2020. I was inspired to use birthweights because it was a significant topic in a recent unit of the anthropology course that I am currently taking. I wanted to see what disparities, if there were any, occurred in rates of low birthweights across Arizona. I considered using the raw numbers of low birthweights, but ultimately decided that using low birthweights per 100 would provide a more statistically accurate picture.</h3>
